## Belief & Opinion

It’s important to distinguish between objective truths and subjective values.

### Objective Matters

-   Objective matters are matters which can be true or false independently from the person holding any position.
    -   ‘The rotation of the earth causes a day/night cycle once every approx 24 hours.’
    -   Positions on Objective matters are true or false independently of your existence.
-   A position held on an objective matter is called a **Belief**.
-   Given sufficient justification, positions on objective matters are called **Truth** or **Knowledge**.
-   Your beliefs can be accurate or inaccurate, depending on how well your models of reality match actual reality, insofar as how well serves to inform your actions.
    -   Newton’s model of gravity is accurate enough when used to design a building, but a more accurate model like Einstein’s is required to account for time dilation in GPS. Newton’s mode isn’t wrong, just not precise enough for the job.

### Subjective Matters

-   Subjective matters are matters which only apply to the person holding the position.
-   Positions on Subjective matters exist only within the person’s own mind.
    -   ‘The day is too short.’
-   A position held on a subjective matter is called an **Opinion**.
-   Given sufficient weight, positions on subjective matters are called **Values** or **Preferences**.
-   An opinion cannot be accurate or inaccurate, they can only be assessed for their compatibility with the opinions of others weighted by closeness and importance.

### Combined Statements

“Oak trees are better than pine trees because they provide more shade” is communicating two individual positions:

-   Objective: Oak trees provide more shade than pine trees.
-   Subjective: More shade is preferred.

Questioning the accuracy of the objective claim is legitimate, and incompatible with responses like “everyone’s entitled to their own opinions”.

Questioning the subjective claim is simply a matter of competing interests’ preferences, incompatible with responses like “you are wrong”.

### Conflation

Be careful of those who conflate the two; at best it’s a grave error in thought, at worst it’s an intentional attempt to manipulate.

-   It is not possible to hold an opinion on an objective matter. It’s not possible to value or prefer an objective matter.
-   It’s not possible to hold a belief on a subjective matter. It’s not correct to consider subjective matters as truth or knowledge.

Notice the difference you feel between those two statements. The world is full of individuals and groups trying to impose their subjective positions (values, preferences, morals) onto others by manipulating language to attempt to have those subjective positions treated as if they’re objective.

## Ethics of Belief

### Consequences of adopting Inaccurate Beliefs

#### Harm to others

Beliefs are not isolated inconsequential acts, they are the adoption of units of information that collate to inform an individual’s understanding of reality.
This understanding is then used, alongside their values, to inform and determine their actions.

Should a person’s model of reality depart sufficiently from actual reality, their actions will result in unintended and possibly harmful consequences.

#### Compounding Credulity

If one is in the habit of believing things for bad reasons, it’s far more likely that this person holds many false beliefs. New information and positions are evaluated against its compatibility with existing beliefs, so this has a rapidly compounding effect. This happens not only at the scale of an individual, but also at the scale of groups, organisations, and societies.

#### Undermining Cooperation and Social Wellbeing

When we have compatible beliefs, such as beliefs about the laws of physics, these beliefs can help us to cooperate and achieve common goals. However, if people are willing to believe things without sufficient evidence, then it becomes more difficult to reach consensus on important issues and to work together effectively.

### Evaluating the Morality of a Belief

One cannot simply measure the truthfulness nor justness of a belief inasmuch as it is merely similar or compatible with your own, as that is not any more likely to select for truthful beliefs than random chance; after all, you may be the one who is wrong.

Similarly, no expectation can be made of knowledge or information beyond the reach, capabilities, or capacity of an individual or group to ascertain. There is no such thing as perfect knowledge, nor infinite capacity.

The evaluation of a quality of belief therefore cannot be regarding the content of the belief, but must be in the method by which the belief is ascertained; measured by how well we understand that method to filter for accuracy and specificity.

The judgement of how unethical the act of belief is thus proportional to the magnitude of the discrepancy between:

1.  the confidence in accuracy and specificity of the holder of this belief, and
2.  the confidence reasonably afforded by the reasoned/measured accuracy and specificity of the method used to judge it’s validity.

# Perspective

## **Lessons**

### Life is disappointing [🎬](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNdgT6VCuu0)

Things don’t get better, you just get better at dealing with them.

### People are a bit shit

Nobody really knows what they’re doing; the people that believe they do are simply arrogant and unaware of the ways in which they’re incompetent.

### Everything changes

Nothing is forever, everything is in flux; be flexible and adapt, or you will be left behind.

### Suffering is (often) a choice

Suffering happens when you care, so care wisely.

### There is no” You”, nor “I”

“You” is just a story that you tell yourself. Where you end and the outside world begins is an artificial distinction.

### You are not that important

People don’t think about you nearly as much as you think they do; you are a tiny, insignificant, ephemeral speck in a vast, cold, empty, uncaring universe.
